										<p>We would like to process your claim quickly, but can&rsquo;t do it without your help.</p>
<p>Keep these tips in mind to avoid delays and receive your benefits faster:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Apply online.</strong>&nbsp;It&rsquo;s faster than printing and mailing or faxing your application to us. If you are filing for family caregiving, it also allows your family member's&nbsp;medical provider to easily complete their section online once they get the required instructions from you. <strong>Remember, </strong>it is your responsibility to give these instructions to the medical provider to complete &ndash; they are <strong><em>not</em></strong> automatically notified by our system. If you do apply online, don&rsquo;t <em>also</em> submit that claim by mail or fax. That may delay the processing of you&rsquo;re application.</li>
<li><strong>Fill out your application completely and accurately</strong>. Read all instructions first. If you&rsquo;re not sure how to answer a question, check out our <a title="FAQ" href="/labor/myleavebenefits/help/faq/fli.shtml">FAQ </a>or&nbsp;<a href="/labor/myleavebenefits/worker/resources/formlookup.shtml">Form Look Up</a> for more information. If you still need help, <a href="/labor/myleavebenefits/help/contact/index.shtml">contact us</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Include your Social Security number</strong> on all correspondence.</li>
<li><strong>Don&rsquo;t fax us pictures of documents. </strong>If you want to submit a digital copy of a document, use a free mobile app like <a title="adobe scan" href="https://acrobat.adobe.com/us/en/mobile/scanner-app.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Adobe Scan</a> or&nbsp;<a title="Dropbox" href="https://www.dropbox.com/mobile" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dropbox</a> to transform a mobile phone picture into a high-contrast, black-and-white PDF file you can print and fax.</li>
<li><strong>Get ready to receive your payments. </strong>Money Network/My Banking Direct will mail your prepaid debit card in a plain envelope (which might even look like junk mail), so check <em>all</em> your mail carefully. If you already have a debit card from a previous Temporary Disability, Family Leave, or Unemployment Insurance claim, we will use that same card to pay benefits for new claims. If you can&rsquo;t find your card,&nbsp;<a title="Money Network" href="https://mbd.everywherepaycard.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contact Money Network/My Banking Direct</a> for a replacement.</li>

										<p><strong>New Jersey workers are encouraged to apply.</strong><br />In order to have a valid claim for&nbsp;Family Leave Insurance, you need to have paid into the program through your employment and meet minimum gross earnings requirements.&nbsp;Family Leave Insurance is available to most New Jersey workers.</p>
<p>Exemptions include:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>federal government employees</li>
<li>out-of-state employees</li>
<li>faith-based organizations</li>
<li>workers that are not technically employees (such as contractors).</li>
</ul>
<p>If your employer is covered for&nbsp;Family Leave Insurance, they are required to set up payroll contributions for you. If you believe&nbsp;you are covered under the program but payroll contributions have not been made, you are still encouraged to apply as it may have been an error.&nbsp; If you became unemployed recently and have a need for&nbsp;Family Leave Insurance, you still may be eligible for benefits and we encourage you to apply. In that case, we will forward your application to our <a title="FLDU" href="/labor/myleavebenefits/worker/resources/FLDU_2020.shtml">Family Leave During Unemployment</a>&nbsp;section.</p>

<p>For example, let&rsquo;s say Steve's first day of family leave is Friday, March 3, 2023. To see how much he would receive weekly on Family Leave Insurance, we look at his reported wages for the first four of the last five completed quarters:&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">This gives us an&nbsp;<strong>average weekly wage</strong>&nbsp;of $404.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Steve&rsquo;s weekly benefit rate is 85% of his average weekly wage:</strong>&nbsp;$343</p>

										<p>We would like to process your claim quickly, but can&rsquo;t do it without your help.</p>
<p>Keep these tips in mind to avoid delays and receive your benefits faster:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Apply online.</strong>&nbsp;It&rsquo;s faster than printing and mailing or faxing your application to us. If you do apply online, don&rsquo;t&nbsp;<em>also</em>&nbsp;submit that claim by mail or fax. That may delay the processing of you&rsquo;re application.</li>
<li><strong>Fill out your application completely and accurately</strong>. Read all instructions first. If you&rsquo;re not sure how to answer a question, check out our&nbsp;<a title="FLI FAQ" href="/labor/myleavebenefits/help/faq/fli.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FAQ&nbsp;</a>or&nbsp;<a href="/labor/myleavebenefits/worker/resources/formlookup.shtml">Form Look Up</a>&nbsp;for more information. If you still need help,&nbsp;<a href="/labor/myleavebenefits/help/contact/index.shtml">contact us</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Include your Social Security number</strong>&nbsp;on all correspondence.</li>
<li><strong>Don&rsquo;t fax us pictures of documents.&nbsp;</strong>If you want to submit a digital copy of a document, use a free mobile app like <a title="Adobe Scan" href="https://acrobat.adobe.com/us/en/mobile/scanner-app.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Adobe Scan</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a title="Dropbox" href="https://www.dropbox.com/mobile" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dropbox</a>&nbsp;to transform a mobile phone picture into a high-contrast, black-and-white PDF file you can print and fax.</li>
<li><strong>Get ready to receive your payments.&nbsp;</strong>Money Network/My Banking Direct will mail your prepaid debit card in a plain envelope (which might even look like junk mail), so check <em>all</em>&nbsp;your mail carefully. If you already have a debit card from a previous Temporary Disability, Family Leave, or Unemployment Insurance claim, we will use that same card to pay benefits for new claims. If you can&rsquo;t find your card,&nbsp;<a title="Money Network" href="https://mbd.everywherepaycard.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contact Money Network/My Banking Direct</a>&nbsp;for a replacement.</li>

										<p><strong>New Jersey workers are encouraged to apply.</strong><br />In order to have a valid claim for&nbsp;Family Leave&nbsp;Insurance, you need to have paid into the program through your employment and meet minimum gross earnings requirements.&nbsp;Family Leave&nbsp;Insurance is available to most New Jersey workers.</p>
<p>Exemptions include:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>federal government employees</li>
<li>out-of-state employees</li>
<li>faith-based organizations</li>
<li>workers that are not technically employees (such as contractors).</li>
</ul>
<p>If your employer is covered for&nbsp;Family Leave&nbsp;Insurance, they are required to set up payroll contributions for you. If you believe&nbsp;you are covered under the program but payroll contributions have not been made, you are still encouraged to apply as it may have been an error.&nbsp; If you became unemployed recently and have a need for&nbsp;Family Leave&nbsp;Insurance, you still may be eligible for benefits and we encourage you to apply. In that case, we will forward your application to&nbsp;our&nbsp;<a title="FLDU" href="/labor/myleavebenefits/worker/resources/FLDU_2020.shtml">Family Leave During Unemployment</a>&nbsp;section.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>2. Now, we&nbsp;can determine your weekly benefit rate.&nbsp;</strong><strong>Claimants are paid 85% of their average weekly wage, up to the maximum weekly benefit rate set for that calendar year.</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong>In 2022, the maximum weekly benefit rate is $993 per week. <br /><br />In 2023, the maximum weekly benefit rate is $1,025 per week.</strong></p>
<p>For example, let&rsquo;s say Steve's first day of family leave is Friday, March 3, 2023. To see how much he would receive weekly on Family Leave Insurance, we look at his reported wages for the first four of the last five completed quarters:&nbsp;</p>

										<p><strong>New Jersey workers are encouraged to apply.</strong><br />In order to have a valid claim for&nbsp;Family Leave&nbsp;Insurance, you need to have paid into the program through your employment and meet minimum gross earnings requirements.&nbsp;Family Leave&nbsp;Insurance is available to most New Jersey workers.</p>
<p>Exemptions include:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>federal government employees</li>
<li>out-of-state employees</li>
<li>faith-based organizations</li>
<li>workers that are not technically employees (such as contractors).</li>
</ul>
<p>If your employer is covered for&nbsp;Family Leave&nbsp;Insurance, they are required to set up payroll contributions for you. If you believe&nbsp;you are covered under the program but payroll contributions have not been made, you are still encouraged to apply as it may have been an error.&nbsp; If you became unemployed recently and have a need for&nbsp;Family Leave&nbsp;Insurance, you still may be eligible for benefits and we encourage you to apply. In that case, we will forward your application to&nbsp;our&nbsp;<a title="FLDU" href="/labor/myleavebenefits/worker/resources/FLDU_2020.shtml">Family Leave During Unemployment</a>&nbsp;section.</p>

										<p>We would like to process your claim quickly, but can&rsquo;t do it without your help.</p>
<p>Keep these tips in mind to avoid delays and receive your benefits faster:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Apply online.</strong>&nbsp;It&rsquo;s faster than printing and mailing or faxing your application to us.&nbsp;If you do apply online, don&rsquo;t&nbsp;<em>also</em>&nbsp;submit that claim by mail or fax. That may delay the processing of you&rsquo;re application.</li>
<li><strong>Fill out your application completely and accurately</strong>. Read all instructions first. If you&rsquo;re not sure how to answer a question, check out our&nbsp;<a title="FAQ" href="/labor/myleavebenefits/help/faq/fli.shtml">FAQ&nbsp;</a>or&nbsp;<a href="/labor/myleavebenefits/worker/resources/formlookup.shtml">Form Look Up</a>&nbsp;for more information. If you still need help,&nbsp;<a href="/labor/myleavebenefits/help/contact/index.shtml">contact us</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Include your Social Security number</strong>&nbsp;on all correspondence.</li>
<li><strong>Don&rsquo;t fax us pictures of documents.&nbsp;</strong>If you want to submit a digital copy of a document (such as a birth certificate), use a free mobile app like&nbsp;<a title="adobe scan" href="https://acrobat.adobe.com/us/en/mobile/scanner-app.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Adobe Scan</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a title="Dropbox" href="https://www.dropbox.com/mobile" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dropbox</a>&nbsp;to transform a mobile phone picture into a high-contrast, black-and-white PDF file you can print and fax.</li>
<li><strong>Get ready to receive your payments.&nbsp;</strong>Money Network/My Banking Direct will mail your prepaid debit card in a plain envelope (which might even look like junk mail), so check <em>all</em>&nbsp;your mail carefully. If you already have a debit card from a previous Temporary Disability, Family Leave, or Unemployment Insurance claim, we will use that same card to pay benefits for new claims. If you can&rsquo;t find your card,&nbsp;<a title="Money Network" href="https://mbd.everywherepaycard.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contact Money Network/My Banking Direct</a>&nbsp;for a replacement.</li>

										<p><strong>New Jersey workers are encouraged to apply.</strong><br />In order to have a valid claim for&nbsp;Family Leave&nbsp;Insurance, you need to have paid into the program through your employment and meet minimum gross earnings requirements.&nbsp;Family Leave&nbsp;Insurance is available to most New Jersey workers.</p>
<p>Exemptions include:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>federal government employees</li>
<li>out-of-state employees</li>
<li>faith-based organizations</li>
<li>workers that are not technically employees (such as contractors).</li>

<p>If your employer is covered for&nbsp;Family Leave&nbsp;Insurance, they are required to set up payroll contributions for you. If you believe&nbsp;you are covered under the program but payroll contributions have not been made, you are still encouraged to apply as it may have been an error.&nbsp; If you became unemployed recently and have a need for&nbsp;Family Leave&nbsp;Insurance, you still may be eligible for benefits and we encourage you to apply.

<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>2.

<p>For example, let&rsquo;s say Steve's first day of family leave is Friday, March 3, 2023. To see how much he would receive weekly on Family Leave Insurance, we look at his reported wages for the first four of the last five completed quarters:&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is the information we need to complete your application:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>From you:</strong>
<ul>

<li>The date your caregiving leave begins</li>

										<p>We would like to process your claim quickly, but can&rsquo;t do it without your help.</p>
<p>Keep these tips in mind to avoid delays and receive your benefits faster:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Apply online.</strong>&nbsp;It&rsquo;s faster than printing and mailing or faxing your application to us. If you are filing for family caregiving, it also allows your family member's&nbsp;medical provider to easily complete their section online once they get the required instructions from you.&nbsp;<strong>Remember,&nbsp;</strong>it is your responsibility to give these instructions to the medical provider to complete &ndash; they are&nbsp;<strong><em>not</em></strong>&nbsp;automatically notified by our system. If you do apply online, don&rsquo;t&nbsp;<em>also</em>&nbsp;submit that claim by mail or fax. That may delay the processing of you&rsquo;re application.</li>
<li><strong>Fill out your application completely and accurately</strong>. Read all instructions first. If you&rsquo;re not sure how to answer a question, check out our&nbsp;<a title="FAQ" href="/labor/myleavebenefits/help/faq/fli.shtml">FAQ&nbsp;</a>or&nbsp;<a href="/labor/myleavebenefits/worker/resources/formlookup.shtml">Form Look Up</a>&nbsp;for more information. If you still need help,&nbsp;<a href="/labor/myleavebenefits/help/contact/index.shtml">contact us</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Include your Social Security number</strong>&nbsp;on all correspondence.</li>
<li><strong>Don&rsquo;t fax us pictures of documents.&nbsp;</strong>If you want to submit a digital copy of a document (such as a birth certificate), use a free mobile app like&nbsp;<a title="adobe scan" href="https://acrobat.adobe.com/us/en/mobile/scanner-app.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Adobe Scan</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a title="Dropbox" href="https://www.dropbox.com/mobile" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dropbox</a>&nbsp;to transform a mobile phone picture into a high-contrast, black-and-white PDF file you can print and fax.</li>
<li><strong>Get ready to receive your payments.&nbsp;</strong>Money Network/My Banking Direct will mail your prepaid debit card in a plain envelope (which might even look like junk mail), so check <em>all</em>&nbsp;your mail carefully. If you already have a debit card from a previous Temporary Disability, Family Leave, or Unemployment Insurance claim, we will use that same card to pay benefits for new claims. If you can&rsquo;t find your card,&nbsp;<a title="Money Network" href="https://mbd.everywherepaycard.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contact Money Network/My Banking Direct</a>&nbsp;for a replacement.</li>

Having an open discussion with your employer about your need for caregiving leave will allow them to prepare for your absence and make adjustments to work schedules, if necessary.
