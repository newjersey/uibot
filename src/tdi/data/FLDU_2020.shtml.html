										<p><strong>If You're Applying for Family Leave After Receiving Unemployment or Disability During Unemployment Benefits:</strong></p>
<p>All of the Department of Labor benefit programs have the same minimum earnings requirement. Therefore, if you are applying for Family Leave During Unemployment benefits after being approved for Unemployment or Disability During Unemployment Insurance, you have already met the required earnings to receive benefits.</p>
<p><strong>If You Did Not Collect Unemployment or Disability During Unemployment Benefits:</strong></p>
<p>Employers are required to report their employees' wages to the state after each calendar quarter is completed. When your claim is under review, we consider the earnings reported for the 5 completed quarters prior to the week your family leave began. The first 4 quarters of that time frame is&nbsp;called the&nbsp;<a title="base year" href="https://myleavebenefits.nj.gov/labor/myleavebenefits/help/glossary/index.shtml#BaseYear" target="_blank" rel="noopener">base year</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To qualify in 2022, you must have worked 20 weeks earning at least $240 weekly, or have earned a combined total of $12,000 in those four quarters (the base year).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>To qualify in 2023, you must have worked 20 weeks earning at least $260 weekly, or have earned a combined total of $13,000 in those four quarters (the base year).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your&nbsp;regular base year period&nbsp;consists of 52 weeks and is determined by the date you apply for&nbsp;Family Leave During Unemployment benefits, as outlined in the chart below:</p>

										<p><strong>If You're Applying for Family Leave After Receiving Unemployment or Disability During Unemployment Benefits:</strong></p>
<p>If you have an Unemployment Insurance or Disability During Unemployment claim and are now applying for FLDU benefits within that benefit year, you typically will receive the same benefit rate for FLDU as you were receiving on your Unemployment Insurance or Disability During Unemployment Insurance claim. Refer back to the monetary determination notice that you were issued for your prior approved claim, as you will not receive a new one for your Family Leave benefits.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>If You Did Not Collect Unemployment or Disability During Unemployment Benefits:</strong></p>
<p>Your weekly benefit amount is 60% of your average weekly wage, up to a maximum benefit rate set for that calendar year. <br />The maximum weekly FLDU benefit rate in 2022 is $804 per week.<br />The maximum weekly FLDU benefit rate in 2023 is $830 per week.</p>
<p>Benefits are paid for full calendar weeks, beginning Sunday and ending Saturday. After we begin to review your application, you will be mailed a notice explaining your weekly benefit amount and your maximum benefit entitlement. This notice&nbsp;will list all New Jersey covered employers that you worked for during the base year and the wages they reported for you. You should review the monetary determination carefully as soon as you receive it. If you disagree with the benefit amount indicated, or if any employer information is incorrect or incomplete, you should file a written appeal and include documentation to substantiate what needs to be changed. The monetary determination explains how to file an appeal, or you can&nbsp;<a title="appeals FLDU" href="/labor/myleavebenefits/worker/resources/FLDU_2020.shtml#appeal">click here&nbsp;</a>to learn about the appeal process.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><strong>Dependency Benefits:&nbsp;</strong>If you have not already qualified for the maximum weekly benefit rate if/when your claim is approved, you may be entitled to additional benefits as a dependency benefit. Dependency benefits are payable at 7% of your basic weekly benefit rate for your first dependent and then at 4% for each of the next two dependents (you may claim no more than three dependents). You will be sent instructions on how to qualify and apply for dependency benefits after you file your claim.</p>
<p>A dependent may be:</p>
<ul>
<li>an unemployed spouse or civil union partner;</li>
<li>unemployed, unmarried children (including stepchild, and/or legally adopted child) under the age of 19;</li>
<li>unemployed, unmarried children (including stepchild, and/or legally adopted child)&nbsp; under the age of 22 if attending a public or other nonprofit educational institution full time.</li>
</ul>
<p>*If your spouse or civil union partner is unemployed and claimed your children as dependents on their Unemployment claim, you cannot claim the same children as dependents on your Family Leave claim.</p>

Be aware that the maximum benefit amount applies to standard Unemployment benefits only and is not impacted by pandemic related benefit extensions that may be in place at the time of your filing.</p>
<p>For example, let's say Sarah was collecting Unemployment benefits but is now applying for Family Leave to care for an ill family member. Sarah's Unemployment approval notice shows a maximum benefit amount of 20 weeks of Unemployment benefits. If Sarah is approved for Family Leave During Unemployment, the most she can collect from Unemployment and Family Leave During Unemployment&nbsp;<strong><em>combined</em>,</strong> is 30 weeks of benefits (one and one-half times the maximum benefit amount of her initial Unemployment claim).&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>If You Did Not Collect Unemployment or Disability During Unemployment Benefits:</strong></p>
<p>Family Leave During Unemployment benefits can be claimed for up to 12 consecutive weeks in a 12-month period, or up to eight weeks in a 12-month period if claiming benefits on a week-by-week intermittent basis.

<p>Your former employer(s) do not have to verify your wages when applying. All claims in the Department of Labor's Division of Income Security (Temporary Disability, Family Leave, Unemployment, Family Leave During Unemployment, Disability During Unemployment) use the quarterly wages reported to the state by your former employers. However, since Family Leave During Unemployment follows the Unemployment law, we will need to verify the reason for separation from your last employer such as being fired, laid off, on a leave of absence or voluntarily quit. If you were collecting Unemployment or Disability During Unemployment previously, your separation has already been investigated allowing your Family Leave application to be processed without any employer involvement. If you were not approved for Unemployment or Disability During Unemployment previously but still fit the criteria for the FLDU program, your last employer will need to be contacted to verify the reason for separation before benefits can be paid.</p>
<p><strong>If You Are Applying for Family Leave Immediately After Receiving Benefits for A Pregnancy-Related Disability:</strong></p>
<p>Family Leave for bonding immediately following a pregnancy-related disability has a&nbsp;one-page&nbsp;application that requires less information. Once you and your physician notify us of your actual delivery date, we will mail you an&nbsp;application for&nbsp;New Mother Bonding (Form FL2). You may file for Family Leave During Unemployment benefits&nbsp;once you recover from your pregnancy-related disability.</p>

										<p>We would like to process your claim quickly, but can&rsquo;t do it without your help.</p>
<p>Keep these tips in mind to avoid delays and receive your benefits faster:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Apply online.</strong>&nbsp;It&rsquo;s faster than printing and mailing or faxing your application to us. If you are filing for family caregiving, it also allows your family member's&nbsp;medical provider to easily complete their section online once they get the required instructions from you.&nbsp;<strong>Remember,&nbsp;</strong>it is your responsibility to give these instructions to the medical provider to complete &ndash; they are&nbsp;<strong><em>not</em></strong>&nbsp;automatically notified by our system. If you do apply online, do not&nbsp;<em>also</em>&nbsp;submit that claim by mail or fax. That may delay the processing of your application.</li>
<li><strong>Fill out your application completely and accurately</strong>. Read all instructions first. If you&rsquo;re not sure how to answer a question, check out our&nbsp;<a title="FAQ" href="https://myleavebenefits.nj.gov/labor/myleavebenefits/help/faq/fli.shtml">FAQ&nbsp;</a>or&nbsp;<a href="https://myleavebenefits.nj.gov/labor/myleavebenefits/worker/resources/formlookup.shtml">Form Look Up</a>&nbsp;for more information. If you still need help,&nbsp;<a href="https://myleavebenefits.nj.gov/labor/myleavebenefits/help/contact/index.shtml">contact us</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Include your Social Security number</strong>&nbsp;on all correspondence.</li>
<li><strong>Don&rsquo;t fax us pictures of documents.&nbsp;</strong>If you want to submit a digital copy of a document, use a free mobile app like&nbsp;<a title="adobe scan" href="https://acrobat.adobe.com/us/en/mobile/scanner-app.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Adobe Scan</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a title="Dropbox" href="https://www.dropbox.com/mobile" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dropbox</a>&nbsp;to transform a mobile phone picture into a high-contrast, black-and-white PDF file you can print and fax.</li>
<li><strong>Get ready to receive your payments.&nbsp;</strong>Money Network/My Banking Direct will mail your prepaid debit card in a plain envelope that may look like junk mail, so check <em>all</em>&nbsp;your mail carefully. If you already have a debit card from a previous Temporary Disability, Family Leave, or Unemployment Insurance claim, we will use that same card to pay benefits for new claims. If you can&rsquo;t find your card,&nbsp;<a title="Money Network/My Banking Direct" href="https://mbd.everywherepaycard.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contact Money Network/My Banking Direct</a>&nbsp;for a replacement.</li>

										<p>Once we receive your application and see that you fit the criteria for Family Leave During Unemployment, we may<em>&nbsp;temporarily</em>&nbsp;deny your application as a way of routing it to the proper FLDU section. This temporary denial is our internal process of reassigning your claim&nbsp;and has no reflection on the content of your application. Once a Family Leave During Unemployment examiner receives your application, it will be reviewed for claim approval.</p>
<p><strong>If You're Applying for Family Leave After Receiving Unemployment or Disability During Unemployment Benefits:</strong></p>
<p>In general, when an Unemployment Insurance or Disability During Unemployment claim exists, Family Leave applications with complete information are determined within seven to ten days from the date of receipt. If you were receiving Unemployment Insurance, there may be a delay in benefits from when you stop your weekly certification and when FLDU starts paying you-as it will take time for your new application to make it's way to an examiner. You will be paid retroactively by Family Leave During Unemployment for this delay. If you were receiving Disability During Unemployment Insurance and you provided them with Family Leave paperwork, they may initiate the transfer of your claim to FLDU so that the transition is seamless.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>If You Did Not Collect Unemployment or Disability During Unemployment Benefits:</strong></p>
<p>When an Unemployment or Disability During Unemployment&nbsp;claim does not exist, additional information must be gathered and it may take approximately three to four weeks to issue a determination.&nbsp;</p>
