										<p><strong>If You're Applying for&nbsp;Temporary Disability After Receiving Unemployment or Family Leave During Unemployment Benefits:</strong></p>
<p>In most cases, if you are applying for DDU benefits after being approved for Unemployment or Family Leave During Unemployment Insurance you have already met the&nbsp;DDU minimum earnings requirement, provided&nbsp;all earnings used on your claim were in New Jersey and covered for Temporary Disability Insurance. Keep in mind, the Unemployment earnings criteria&nbsp;may include municipal, federal, military, and/or out of state wages.&nbsp;When qualifying for Disability During Unemployment benefits, those earnings do not count towards eligibility.</p>
<p><strong>If You Did Not Collect Unemployment or Family Leave During Unemployment Benefits:</strong></p>
<p>Employers are required to report their employees' wages to the state after each calendar quarter is completed. When your claim is under review, we consider your New Jersey covered earnings reported for the 5 completed quarters prior to the week your disability period began. The first 4 quarters of that time frame is&nbsp;called the&nbsp;<a title="base year" href="https://myleavebenefits.nj.gov/labor/myleavebenefits/help/glossary/index.shtml#BaseYear" target="_blank" rel="noopener">base year</a>.</p>
<p>To qualify in 2022, you must have worked 20 weeks earning at least $240 weekly, or have earned a combined total of $12,000 in those four quarters (the base year).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>To qualify in 2023, you must have worked 20 weeks earning at least $260 weekly, or have earned a combined total of $13,000 in those four quarters (the base year).</p>
<p>Your&nbsp;regular base year period&nbsp;consists of 52 weeks and is determined by the date you apply for Disability During Unemployment benefits, as outlined in the chart below:</p>

<p>The wages earned during your base year will determine the amount of weekly benefits you may receive, and the total amount you can collect during the life of a claim.</p>

										<p><strong>If You're Applying for Temporary Disability After&nbsp;Applying For Unemployment or Family Leave During Unemployment Benefits:</strong></p>
<p>If&nbsp;your previous&nbsp;claim met the earnings requirement to qualify, a&nbsp;12-month period (known as the benefit year) was established. If you are now applying for Temporary Disability benefits within that&nbsp;benefit year, your Disability During Unemployment claim will have&nbsp;the same start date as your prior claim, whether you were previously approved for benefits or not.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>If You Did Not Collect Unemployment or Family Leave During Unemployment Benefits:</strong></p>
<p>If you do not have an&nbsp;existing&nbsp;Unemployment Insurance or Family Leave During Unemployment claim that can be used, the date of claim will be the Sunday of the week in which you become unable to work and apply for DDU benefits. The benefit year is the 12-month period starting on the first day of benefits claimed.</p>
<p>For example, let's say Steve's first day of Disability During Unemployment is Friday, March 3, 2023 and he does not have a prior Unemployment or Family Leave During Unemployment claim. Steve's DDU claim will begin on the Sunday before his disability date (Sunday, February 26, 2023). His benefit year will run from Sunday, February 26, 2023 through Saturday, February 24, 2024.&nbsp;</p>

										<p><strong>If You're Applying for&nbsp;Temporary Disability After Receiving Unemployment or&nbsp;Family Leave During Unemployment Benefits:</strong></p>
<p>If you have an Unemployment Insurance or Family Leave During Unemployment claim and are now applying for DDU benefits, you typically will receive the same benefit rate for DDU as you were receiving on your prior approved claim, provided all earnings were in New Jersey and covered for Temporary Disability Insurance. Refer back to the monetary determination notice that you were issued for your prior approved claim, as you will not receive a new one for your DDU benefits.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>If You Did Not Collect Unemployment or Family Leave During Unemployment Benefits:</strong></p>
<p>Your weekly benefit amount is 60% of your average weekly wage, up to a maximum benefit rate set for that calendar year. <br />The maximum weekly DDU benefit rate in 2022 is $804 per week.<br />The maximum weekly DDU benefit rate in 2023 is $830 per week.</p>
<p>Benefits are paid for full calendar weeks, beginning Sunday and ending Saturday. After we begin to review your application, you will be mailed a notice explaining your weekly benefit amount and your maximum benefit entitlement. This notice&nbsp;will list all New Jersey covered employers that you worked for during the base year and the wages they reported for you. You should review the monetary determination carefully as soon as you receive it. If you disagree with the benefit amount indicated, or if any employer information is incorrect or incomplete, you should file a written appeal and include documentation to substantiate what needs to be changed. The monetary determination explains how to file an appeal, or you can&nbsp;<a title="appeals DDU" href="/labor/myleavebenefits/worker/resources/DDU_2020.shtml#appeal">click here&nbsp;</a>to learn about the appeal process.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Dependency Benefits:&nbsp;</strong>If you have not already qualified for the maximum weekly benefit rate if/when your claim is approved, you may be entitled to additional benefits as a dependency benefit. Dependency benefits are payable at 7% of your basic weekly benefit rate for your first dependent and then at 4% for each of the next two dependents (you may claim no more than three dependents). You will be sent instructions on how to qualify and apply for dependency benefits after you file your claim.</p>
<p>A dependent may be:</p>
<ul>
<li>an unemployed spouse or civil union partner;</li>
<li>unemployed, unmarried children (including stepchild, and/or legally adopted child) under the age of 19;</li>
<li>unemployed, unmarried children (including stepchild, and/or legally adopted child)&nbsp; under the age of 22 if attending a public or other nonprofit educational institution full time.</li>
</ul>
<p>*If your spouse or civil union partner is unemployed and claimed your children as dependents on their Unemployment claim, you cannot claim the same children as dependents on your Disability During Unemployment claim.</p>

Be aware that the maximum benefit amount applies to standard Unemployment benefits only and is not impacted by pandemic related benefit extensions that may be in place at the time of your filing.</p>
<p>For example, let's say Sarah was collecting Unemployment benefits but is now applying for&nbsp;Temporary Disability and her Unemployment approval notice shows a maximum benefit of $10,000.

<p><strong>If You Did Not Collect Unemployment or&nbsp;Family Leave During Unemployment Benefits:</strong></p>
<p>You may receive one week of benefits for each base week you worked in your&nbsp;<a title="base year definition." href="https://myleavebenefits.nj.gov/labor/myleavebenefits/help/glossary/index.shtml#Baseyear">base year</a> period, up to a maximum of 26 weeks. In 2023, a base week is any week with earnings of $260 or more.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, let's say in Sarah's base year period she worked 22 weeks earning atleast $260. If Sarah's DDU claim is approved, she may collect up to 22 weeks of benefits in the benefit year.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>When you complete your part online, you will get a unique&nbsp;<strong>Online Form ID</strong>&nbsp;number to give to your medical provider. They will use this number to submit their part to us online. You will be prompted to print out (or save as a PDF file) a page that has your unique Online Form ID number, along with instructions for your medical provider to follow. If you do not have access to a printer when&nbsp;initially filing your application, you have a fourteen day window to return and&nbsp;print the instructions&nbsp;when a printer is available. You can do&nbsp;so by clicking&nbsp;<a title="Access claim documents" href="https://secure.dol.state.nj.us/tdi/caller.aspx?Source=TDI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Access claim documents</a>&nbsp;at the top of this page.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If planning ahead, you can start the online application process up to 60 days' in advance and it will be saved as a draft. Once your disability period begins, you must return to your draft (within 14 days' of the start of your leave) to certify and submit your application. If applying after disability period begins, you have 30 days' from your first day of disability to file your application.&nbsp;</p>

										<p>We would like to process your claim quickly, but can&rsquo;t do it without your help.</p>
<p>Keep these tips in mind to avoid delays and receive your benefits faster:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Apply online.</strong>&nbsp;It&rsquo;s faster than printing and mailing or faxing your application to us.&nbsp;<strong>Remember,&nbsp;</strong>it is your responsibility to give these instructions to the medical provider to complete &ndash; they are&nbsp;<strong><em>not</em></strong>&nbsp;automatically notified by our system. If you do apply online, do not&nbsp;<em>also</em>&nbsp;submit that claim by mail or fax. That may delay the processing of your application.</li>
<li><strong>Fill out your application completely and accurately</strong>. Read all instructions first. If you&rsquo;re not sure how to answer a question, check out our&nbsp;<a title="FAQ" href="https://myleavebenefits.nj.gov/labor/myleavebenefits/help/faq/fli.shtml">FAQ&nbsp;</a>or&nbsp;<a href="https://myleavebenefits.nj.gov/labor/myleavebenefits/worker/resources/formlookup.shtml">Form Look Up</a>&nbsp;for more information. If you still need help,&nbsp;<a href="https://myleavebenefits.nj.gov/labor/myleavebenefits/help/contact/index.shtml">contact us</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Include your Social Security number</strong>&nbsp;on all correspondence.</li>
<li><strong>Don&rsquo;t fax us pictures of documents.&nbsp;</strong>If you want to submit a digital copy of a document, use a free mobile app like&nbsp;<a title="adobe scan" href="https://acrobat.adobe.com/us/en/mobile/scanner-app.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Adobe Scan</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a title="Dropbox" href="https://www.dropbox.com/mobile" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dropbox</a>&nbsp;to transform a mobile phone picture into a high-contrast, black-and-white PDF file you can print and fax.</li>
<li><strong>Get ready to receive your payments.&nbsp;</strong>Money Network/My Banking Direct will mail your prepaid debit card in a plain envelope that may look like junk mail, so check <em>all</em>&nbsp;your mail carefully. If you already have a debit card from a previous Temporary Disability, Family Leave, or Unemployment Insurance claim, we will use that same card to pay benefits for new claims. If you can&rsquo;t find your card,&nbsp;<a title="Money Network" href="https://mbd.everywherepaycard.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contact Money Network/My Banking Direct</a>&nbsp;for a replacement.</li>

										<p>Once we receive your application and see that you fit the criteria for Disability During Unemployment, we may<em>&nbsp;temporarily</em>&nbsp;deny your application as a way of routing it to the proper DDU section. This temporary denial is our internal process of reassigning your claim&nbsp;and has no reflection on the content of your application. Once a Disability During Unemployment examiner receives your application, it will be reviewed for claim approval.</p>
<p><strong>If You're Applying for Temporary Disability After Receiving Unemployment or Family Leave During Unemployment Benefits:</strong></p>
<p>In general, when an Unemployment Insurance or&nbsp;Family Leave During Unemployment claim exists, DDU applications with complete information are determined within seven to ten days from the date of receipt. If you were receiving Unemployment Insurance, there may be a delay in benefits from when you stop your weekly certification and when DDU starts paying you-as it will take time for your new application to make it's way to an examiner. You will be paid retroactively by&nbsp;Disability During Unemployment for this delay. If you were receiving&nbsp;Family Leave During Unemployment and you provided them with the disability paperwork, they may initiate the transfer of your claim to DDU so that the transition is seamless.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>If You Did Not Collect Unemployment or&nbsp;Family Leave&nbsp;During Unemployment Benefits:</strong></p>
<p>When an Unemployment or&nbsp;Family Leave During Unemployment&nbsp;claim does not exist, additional information must be gathered and it may take approximately three to four weeks to issue a determination.&nbsp;</p>

										<p>Yes, you may reopen your Unemployment Insurance claim and&nbsp;resume collecting Unemployment benefits, provided you have not already claimed one and one-half times the maximum benefit amount of your initial claim.<br />For example, let's say Sarah initially collected Unemployment benefits followed by Disability During Unemployment benefits. Her Unemployment approval notice shows a maximum benefit of $10,000. If Sarah wishes to reopen her Unemployment claim, the most she can collect from Unemployment and&nbsp;Disability During Unemployment&nbsp;<strong><em>combined</em>,</strong>&nbsp;is $15,000 in benefits (one and one-half times the maximum benefit amount of her initial Unemployment claim).&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How to Reopen Your Unemployment Claim:&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>With the high volume&nbsp;that Unemployment is currently facing, we found that&nbsp;it is best to <em><strong>notify DDU</strong></em> of your intent to return to Unemployment Insurance. This way, we can assist you to ensure a smooth transition&nbsp;between the two programs.<br />Notify DDU by calling<strong>:</strong>&nbsp;(609) 292-3349 or (609) 292-3842. If you try to reopen your Unemployment claim online without first notifying DDU,&nbsp;the online application won't&nbsp;let you proceed.&nbsp;</p>

										<p>When we receive an application that is referred to Disability During Unemployment, we often only have the information needed to comply with the Temporary Disability benefits law and not the Unemployment Insurance law. In these cases, we send a questionnaire with&nbsp;additional criteria needed for Unemployment, such as the reason for separation from work, if you wish to claim dependency benefits, and if you received any sick, vacation, or other paid time off after your last day of work. Be sure to complete and return the entire questionnaire so that we may review your claim for eligibility. If you are&nbsp;claiming DDU benefits immediately after&nbsp;receiving&nbsp;Unemployment,&nbsp;we already have this information from your Unemployment claim.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Missing Medical Information</strong><br />The Temporary Disability benefit application consists of your part&nbsp;along with your healthcare provider's part. When completing the application online, be sure to provide your healthcare provider with your unique form ID number (provided after submitting your statement). They will use this number to submit their part to us online. It is your responsibility to provide them with your form ID number and it isn't&nbsp;automatically sent to them. If completing the <em>paper</em> benefit application, you must complete Parts A and B and have your healthcare provider complete Part C-Medical Certificate. If we do not receive a medical statement either online or through the paper application, we will send you additional paperwork to complete causing a delay or temporary denial of your benefits.&nbsp;</p>
